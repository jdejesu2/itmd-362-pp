1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13D0u0kqEll00A-EktSmPanC+5R
Your Rationale: I chose blue as the main color because (as much as I don't want to admit it) games are known to be played by guys, or simply more of a masculine thing to do, which is represented by the color blue. There also follows more darken blue colors that can be helped linked together different elements of a game console.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=51T0u0knvvn00QLdBjmmU4z00i3
Your Rationale: Springtime can be represented by yellows, greens, lilac like colors, and one dark color (like wood from trees). From this, I chose cooled down colors of the colors that represent spring, since spring can be seen as a rainy and chilly season. I also felt it necessary to show themed colors to show rebirth plants and it's well known colors like green and dark brown.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=30i0u0klv%2B%2Bdx%2B%2BiLZFlV%2B%2BmU%2B%2B
Your Rationale: Bright but yet simple colors are needed to get a kids attention to be able to want them to interact yet feel welcomed by the app. These cool can give the kid a seem of excitement to play with the app since they are vivid colors, but also cool toned to give them a sense of security and calmed to keep on play with it and to stay engaged.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=a3X3C0knBfp5JmX5JmXxsiIiO1%2B
Your Rationale: For this palette I also leaned on the blue side, but more darken colors. When I think of cybersecurity, I think of a dark room and computers so I automatically went for dark blue colors which strangely remind me of coding and software.
