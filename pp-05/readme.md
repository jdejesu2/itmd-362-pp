# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist
2. https://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/layoutchecklist.html

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Load-Time is reasonable: if the page isn't formatted appropriately and it drags for the page to load, the user might get frustrated and leave the page.

2. Font-size and Spacing allows easy reading: make sure that large text isn't too large where its obnoxious but also large enough text where the user isn't struggling to read what on a page

3. Clear path to company info: user will like to know no only what they're visiting but who made it; like if they have a big question on something, there needs to be a way to get into contact with someone who can assist them, so in text include contact information

4. Navigation labels are clear and concise: don't have anything thing too wordy, some people don't like reading too much; “Your main navigation should be short, to the point, and easy for mere mortals to grasp”

5. Number of Button and Links are reasonable: psychological have said that people can simply process 7 or so pieces, so if your menu or selection options consist of too much, it can clutter your page up and not make it friendly
