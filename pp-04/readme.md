# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/buttons/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I took the usage of title-case for titles where it states that you should capitalize every word, to me it informs the reader that it's the beginning of a new task. Also the keep titles short since they say that overly long text can crowd your interface really can really through off user with small screens.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/layout/structure.html#structure-system-bars
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I never really thought about how you have to also work with the color of the status bar when it comes to mobile. And when it comes to the app bar, the titles colors have to work with it, "all icons should be the same color". "The title can have a distinct color from the icons if increased visual hierarchy is needed. Distinct title colors work best on backgrounds with enough contrast for both white and black glyphs." So I went with the basic color scheme of colors red, white, and black.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/labels/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: For this one, I always tend to keep labels legible and it makes sense. Labels should include plain or styled text. Like even if you choose a different font, it should be legible and readable by the user, should distract them or give them a hard time to read it.
